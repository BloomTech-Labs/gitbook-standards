This document describes the engineering standards that teams working in Lambda X must comply with. Adherence to these standards is critical to the continued success of the Lambda X organization, as they allow us to more effectively manage the scores of teams working across hundreds of products.

### Topics

This guide is divided into separate topics. A topic corresponds to a specific area of concern in software engineering. For example, [Programming Languages](coding/programming-languages.md) is a topic.

### Standards

The standards in this guide do not cover all choices in technology. Many are purposely omitted as they are not considered impactful to the quality of the overall program.

However, this guide is exclusive, in that, if a technology choice is _not_ mentioned as part of a topic, you can assume the use of that technology is prohibited. When in doubt, please open an issue or submit a PR to start a discussion.

### Contributing

These standards will morph over time as we adapt to the ever-changing technology landscape. In addition, the standards will embrace a subset of all of the available technologies, so that teams have options when making technical decisions. In order to ensure that these documents are inclusive of the needs of all Labs groups, each new standard or change to an existing standard will be ratified by approval from Labs Engineering Managers.

See [Writing Standards](writing-standards.md) for more details on the format for standards.
