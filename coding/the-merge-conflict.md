# The Merge Conflict

When working on a team there will be many opportunities to experience a conflict when merging branches that git will not be able to resolve automatically for you. In these senarios you will need to manually resolve the conflicts.

* if you question any part of the conflict make sure to pair with the team member whose code you are colliding with.
